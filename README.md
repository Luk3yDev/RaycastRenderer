# C++ Raycast Renderer
This is a simple raycast renderer written in C++ using SDL2.

## Installation
You will need to install the SDL2 library [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.8) and add it to the project in Visual Studio.

## Resources
I read [this](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) paper on raycasting in C++ and adapted it to work in SDL2.

## Usage
Maps are created in [this](https://github.com/Luk3yDev/RaycastMapEditor) C++ program that I also developed for this project. It is very rudementary as of current.

## Personal note
This is my first C++ program, I've done a lot of programming in the past but not at this level. I apologise if some things are done in unorthodox ways or aren't structured nicely.
